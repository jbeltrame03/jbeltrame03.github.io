        <h2>Preliminary Design of Hybrid-Electric Military Cargo Aircraft</h2>
        <img src="Isometric.png" alt="Project Image">
        <br></br>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            For my senior design capstone class, I lead a team that was tasked with performing the design of a hybrid-electric military utility aircraft.
            The vehicle had to be capable of flight powered by just generators, just batteries or a combination of both at once.
            This project allowed me to learn about the design process for an aicraft as well as apply the skills and experience from my previous 3 years of classwork.

        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
            <strong>Design Requirements:</strong>
            <br></br>
            For this project, we worked with Verdego Aero, a company that builds a variety of generators that can be used for powering hybrid-electric aircraft.
            The following were the list of requirements set forth in their proposal for the team:
            <br></br>

            <ul>
                <li>Crew of 2</li>
                <li>Capable of Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) of less than 500 ft</li>
                <li>Payload of 2000 lb, excluding the crew</li>
                <li>Cruise speed of 175 kts</li>
                <li>Capable of entering battery only flight for durations of the flight</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>20 nm cruise</li>
                    <li>Ascent and descent</li>
                    <li>Short takeoff and landing</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Range of 650 nm</li>
                <li>Use at least one Verdego Aero generator</li>
            </ul>

            <br></br>
            In addition to the required design goals, the team established some items that we wanted to implement to enhance the aircraft.
            <br></br>

            <ul></ul>
                <li>Makes use of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)</li>
                <li>More maneuverable than traditional cargo/utility aircraft</li>
                <li>Use of batteries for all takeoffs, ascents, descents and landings</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br></br>

            <strong>Conclusions:</strong> 

            <br></br>

            Throughout this entire experiment, a lot was learned. 
            Specifically, about the design process and iteration. 
            I spent countless hours going back and forth, researching different materials and shapes for different spars, and then simulating them and then adding everything into the CAD design. 
            Additionally, I learned a lot while doing the manufacturing.
            pecifically, tolerancing when 3D printing and the need for this, as well as the importance to test material adhesion before assembly.

            <br></br>

            There are a few things that I think could have been done better.
            As mentioned before, I think that the skin panels should have been attached using fusion with a soldering iron. 
            I also think that a better material could have been chosen for the skin, such as monokote.
            This wasn’t used as it would have had a higher cost, as we would have needed an iron and the material, as well as it wasn’t available in the time we needed it. 
            Additionally, this could have all raised adhesion problems with the 3D printed ribs.
