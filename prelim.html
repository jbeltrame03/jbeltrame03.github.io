        <h2>Preliminary Design of Hybrid-Electric Military Utility Aircraft</h2>
        <img src="Prelim/it2_png.png" alt="Project Image">
        <br></br>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            For my senior design capstone, I led a team tasked with designing a hybrid-electric military utility aircraft incorporating a Verdego Aero hybrid-electric powerplant. 
            The aircraft was required to operate in three configurations: all-electric battery flight, generator-powered flight, and hybrid operation using both systems.

        </p>


        <p>
            <strong>Design Requirements:</strong>
            <br></br>
            The project was based on an RFP from Verdego Aero. The requirements included:

            <ul>
                <li>Crew of 2</li>
                <li>Capable of Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) of less than 500 ft</li>
                <li>Payload of 2000 lb, excluding the crew</li>
                <li>Cruise speed of 175 kts</li>
                <li>Capable of entering battery only flight for durations of the flight</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>20 nm cruise</li>
                    <li>Ascent and descent</li>
                    <li>Short takeoff and landing</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Range of 650 nm</li>
                <li>Use at least one Verdego Aero generator</li>
            </ul>


            Additionally, the team derived a set of requirements to maximize the product: distributed electric propulsion (DEP), improved maneuverability, and battery-powered takeoff, climb, descent, and landing.

            <br></br>
            The mission was defined as an infiltration/exfiltration profile. 
            Upon approaching the target, the aircraft transitions to “Quiet Flight,” using batteries for cruise, descent, landing, takeoff, and climb-out to reduce noise levels.
            While the aircraft is certified under Mil-Handbook, certain requirements from 14 CFR were taken to maximize safety and reliability of the aircraft.
        </p>

            <br></br>
            <strong>Weight Estimation</strong> 

            <br></br>

            The initial weight estimate was calculated using fuel fractions for each mission segment. 
            Extra fuel storage, up to 45 minutes of fuel reserves were added. 
            Since the aircraft relied so heavily on battery power, extra fuel was essential in case in-flight battery issues occurred. 
            Battery use was maximized, since their weight was a constant throughout the flight. 
            The preliminary MTOW was 13,000 lb, refined to 12,250 lb using statistical weight buildup methods.

            <strong>Constraint Analysis and Performance Goals</strong> 

            <br></br>

            Constraint analysis identified a wing loading of 32 lb/ft² and installed power of ~660 kW to meet a 1,500 ft/min climb rate. 
            The cruise altitude was selected as 10,000 ft for unpressurized operation and reduced weight.

        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Configuration and Layout</strong> 

            <br></br>

            The aircraft was designed as a small transport-class platform with a high-wing configuration for terrain flexibility and cargo access.
            An initial V-tail configuration was selected for redundancy and increased stability with multiple high-torque electric motors.
            This was later transitioned to a T-tail to improve tail effectiveness, reduce structural weight, and allow a smaller horizontal stabilizer.
            

            <br></br>
            The aircraft incorporates two Verdego Aero VH-4T generators. 
            In cruise, one powers the electric motors, while the second recharges batteries, providing redundancy and allowing generator-only operation if required. 
            The generators are fuselage-mounted between the cockpit and cargo bay, isolated by firewalls.

            <br></br>
            To reduce cruise drag, retractable landing gear was employed. 
            Due to the high-wing layout, a dedicated landing gear nacelle was used. 
            Design challenges included sizing the landing gear to meet tip-back angle, terrain compatibility, structural strength, and managing internal volume restrictions.

            <br></br>
            Payload volume targets were established by benchmarking similar aircraft, resulting in a goal of 300 cubic feet. 
            Standard 40×40 in shipping pallets were selected for versatility and compatibility throughout the world. 
            Batteries were placed beneath the cargo floor to maintain center-of-gravity limits. 
            To maximize the accessibility and ease of operation, the floor is made of removable panels equipped with rollers. 
            This enables quick and easy access to the batteries for maintenance and improves loading and unloading of cargo.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Aerodynamics</strong> 

            <br></br>

            NACA 23015 and 23012 airfoils were selected for the root and tip respectively. 
            They offered good performance, with a high efficiency and high stall angle. 
            The taper ratio increased from 0.3 to 0.6 to improve lift distribution and wing area, which helped to amplify the effects of DEP. 
            A straight leading edge was selected to simplify motor integration and promote uniform spanwise flow. 
            Propeller placement and spacing were optimized to maximize induced velocity over the wing. 
            
            <br></br>
            Double-slotted Fowler flaps were selected to further improve DEP effectiveness. 
            They can deflect up to 55 degrees yielding a CLmax of 5.5 at takeoff and landing. 
            A CLmax of 1.8 is achieved in cruise. In the takeoff roll, a CLmax of 4.9 is achieved before the pitch up starts. 
            CLmax at takeoff occurs at an angle of attack of 7 degrees, which the aircraft can easily achieve. 

            <br></br>

            Drag buildup gave parasitic drag of 0.0185 at takeoff and landing and 0.0349 in cruise. 
            The induced drag dominates during takeoff and landing due to the high lift. 
            At takeoff and landing, the induced drag is 1.018, and at cruise it is 0.0118. 
            This gives a total CD of 1.053 at takeoff and landing and 0.02242 in cruise.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Takeoff and Landing Performance</strong> 

            <br></br>

            The aircraft achieves 190 ft takeoff and 155 ft landing distances, which well exceeds the requirements of the RFP, enabling operations from unimproved surfaces and carrier decks. 
            This type of performance is comparable to aircraft such as the Electra Aero EL9.
