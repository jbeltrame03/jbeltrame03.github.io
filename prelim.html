        <h2>Preliminary Design of Hybrid-Electric Military Cargo Aircraft</h2>
        <img src="Isometric.png" alt="Project Image">
        <br></br>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            For my senior design capstone class, I lead a team that was tasked with performing the design of a hybrid-electric military utility aircraft.
            The vehicle had to be capable of flight powered by just generators, just batteries or a combination of both at once.
            This project allowed me to learn about the design process for an aicraft as well as apply the skills and experience from my previous 3 years of classwork.

        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
            <strong>Design Requirements:</strong>
            <br></br>
            For this project, we worked with Verdego Aero, a company that builds a variety of generators that can be used for powering hybrid-electric aircraft.
            The following were the list of requirements set forth in their proposal for the team:
            <br></br>

            <ul>
                <li>Crew of 2</li>
                <li>Capable of Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) of less than 500 ft</li>
                <li>Payload of 2000 lb, excluding the crew</li>
                <li>Cruise speed of 175 kts</li>
                <li>Capable of entering battery only flight for durations of the flight</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>20 nm cruise</li>
                    <li>Ascent and descent</li>
                    <li>Short takeoff and landing</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Range of 650 nm</li>
                <li>Use at least one Verdego Aero generator</li>
            </ul>

            <br></br>
            In addition to the required design goals, the team established some items that we wanted to implement to enhance the aircraft.
            <br></br>

            <ul></ul>
                <li>Makes use of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)</li>
                <li>More maneuverable than traditional cargo/utility aircraft</li>
                <li>Use of batteries for all takeoffs, ascents, descents and landings</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

            <strong>Initial Weight Estimates:</strong> 

            <br></br>

            The first task that I performed was obtaining an approximate initial weight of the aircraft to serve as a starting point.
            Employing methodology based on historic and legacy data, I was able to obtain an approximate weight that was based off of our mission plan.
            This method did not have the highest accuracy, especially since it did not account for electric propulsion systems, however it provided a point to build from.

        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Wing Planform Design:</strong> 

            <br></br>

            After the constraint analysis was done, I was able to begin work on the initial sizing of the wing planform for our aircraft.
            Using the wing loading that was found from the constraint analysis, it was possible to obtain the required wing area for our initial weight estimate.
            With the wing area, it was possible to start building the wing geometry.
            Besides the wing area, we had 2 additional goal geometry parameters, our aspect ratio and taper ratio.
            With the goal to optimize for highly efficient cruise, we set out to try and design a wing with an aspect ratio of 10 and taper ratio of 0.3.
            These goals did not last long, as we had to reduce the aspect ratio down to 8 in order to create a more reasonable wing planform.
            A lot of iteration occurred using different aerodynamic analysis software, specifically XFLR5 and VSP.
            The wing planform was continuously tested and iterated, with the goal trying to improve our lift distribution to make it as elliptical as possible.

            <strong>Wing Airfoil Selection:</strong> 

            <br></br>

            Wing airfoil selection was happening simultaneously as wing planform design.
            In this process, many different airfoils were tested.
            There were 3 main goals for airfoil selection:

            <br></br>
            <ul>
            <li>Thicker airfoil at the root</li>
            <ul>
                <li>More space for fuel storage</li>
                <li>Stronger structure</li>
            </ul>
            <li>High lift curve slope</li>
            <li>High efficiency</li>
            <li>Stall angle greater than 10 degrees</li>
            </ul> 

            The preliminary search was looking through available experimental data of existing airfoils.
            Then searching through extensive online databases.
            The final wing airfoils that were selected:

                <ul>
                <li>Root:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NACA 64<sub>4</sub>-421</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Tip:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NACA 64<sub>2</sub>-415</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
