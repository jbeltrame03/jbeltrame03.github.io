        <p><strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            For my Experimental Aerodynamics Lab, we were given the task to do a “DIY Lab” that served as a final project. 
            We had to plan, design, setup, perform and analyze an experiment using a low-speed wind tunnel. 
            My idea was to create a wing that has a diamond airfoil, then test to see the lift and drag of the wing.

            <br></br>

            Our wind tunnel was only very low speed, with a max speed of ~  25m/s (~56mph) or ~ mach 0.07 at MSL conditions. 
            The vehicles using this airfoil fly at much greater speeds, usually supersonic, as diamond airfoils are beneficial for using the shocks generated at the corners to create pressure differentials and thus lift. 
            The idea stemmed from the goal of seeing just how inefficient these airfoils truly were at low subsonic speeds.

            <br></br>

            This was the idea that my group selected, and I worked as the lead on the project. From the get-go, we defined a very clear workflow:
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Calculations</li>
                <li>Design</li>
                <li>Simulate</li>
                <li>Procurement</li>
                <li>Manufacture</li>
                <li>Validate</li>
                <li>Test</li>
                <li>Analyze</li>
                <li>Report</li>
            </ol>


            I directly worked on performing the preliminary calculations, designing the wing, simulating to ensure the constraints were met, procuring all of the necessary supplies, and the manufacturing of the wing. 
            I aided in all of the steps, however I primarily worked on the aforementioned ones.

            <strong>Objectives:</strong>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Design a wing that exceeds the required strength requirements to test, ensuring the wing stays in on piece while tested</li>
                <li>Manufacture the wing that was designed</li>
                <li>Successfully test the wing in the low-speed wind tunnel</li>
                <li>Analyze the lift and drag of the wing to evaluate its effectiveness or ineffectiveness at low speeds</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Conclusions:</strong> 

            <br></br>

            Throughout this entire experiment, a lot was learned. 
            Specifically, about the design process and iteration. 
            I spent countless hours going back and forth, researching different materials and shapes for different spars, and then simulating them and then adding everything into the CAD design. 
            Additionally, I learned a lot while doing the manufacturing.
            pecifically, tolerancing when 3D printing and the need for this, as well as the importance to test material adhesion before assembly.

            <br></br>

            There are a few things that I think could have been done better.
            As mentioned before, I think that the skin panels should have been attached using fusion with a soldering iron. 
            I also think that a better material could have been chosen for the skin, such as monokote.
            This wasn’t used as it would have had a higher cost, as we would have needed an iron and the material, as well as it wasn’t available in the time we needed it. 
            Additionally, this could have all raised adhesion problems with the 3D printed ribs.
