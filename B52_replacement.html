        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Background:</strong> 
            <br></br>
            In my freetime, I wanted to work on designing an aircraft. 
            I decided that I would create an aircraft to replace the aging B-52 Stratofortress. 
            My new design would incorporate modern technology, aerodynamics and modern concepts to try and find something that can far exceed that of the B-52. 
        </p>


        <p>
            <br></br>
            <strong>Design Requirements:</strong>
            <br></br>

            The requirements were based off the B-52 specifications. 
            I took what the B-52 is capable of in terms of performance and payload, and increased these metrics for its replacement.

            <ul>
                <li>Payload: &lt; 100,000 lb</li>
                <li>Range: 13,000 nmi</li>
                <li>Cruise Speed: &lt; Mach 0.85</li>
                <li>Ceiling Altitude: 60,000 ft</li>
                <li>Same footprint as the B-52 (see below)</li>
                <li>Carry an armament consisting of GBU-57s (MOP) as well as GBU-43s (MOAB)</li>
                <li>All armament stored internally</li>
                <li>After an ingress cruise of 6,500 nmi, can loiter for 2 hours, then cruise out for 6,500 nmi without refueling.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Initial Sizing Studies:</strong>
            <br></br>

            The beginning of the study included evaluating the impact of different factors to identify and set the design point that would be used for the B-52 Replacement, herein called the B-72. 
            I first performed various analyses to identify an optimum range of thrust loading and thrust to weight ratios. 
            This provided a ball park range of performance.
            The first study analyzed the impact of parasite drag and Oswalds Efficiency on the T/W with varying wing loading and aspect ratio. 
            The white isobar represents T/W = 0.1 and the red isobar represents T/W = 0.05.
            The study is conducted at M = 0.9 and an altitude of 45,000 ft.
            This graph indicates the aircrafts performance varies more with parasite drag, indicating that parasite drag should more heavily be considered.
            Additionally, this concludes that higher AR designs are favorable, but lower AR is feasible as long as parasite drag is minimzed.
