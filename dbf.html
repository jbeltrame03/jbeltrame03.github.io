        <p><strong>Details</strong> 
            <br></br>
            Throughout the 2023-2024 school year, I served as the Tails Tech Lead on Embry Riddle Daytona's DBF team. 
            During this time, I did all of the CAD modelling in CATIA for the horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, the tail-box and the tail-fuselage integration. 
            Throughout the year, I worked and made multiple revisions ranging from small updates to the dimensions of lightening holes in the ribs, all the way up to complete redesigns when a change was made by the design team. 
            Additionally, I investigated and designed an internal control rod system to bury the control rod acutating linkages inside of the tail surfaces to reduce profile drag on the aircraft. 
            This design did not end up getting implemented and the team kept the standard exposed control rod design. 
            In the end, the team ended up going to the international competition and winning. 
            This marked the first time in Embry Riddle history that our team had won the competition. 
            Below are some images of the final tail structure of the aircraft.
